# ACE Scripts for English Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow

This repository contains my collection of Arbitrary Code Execution scripts for Pokémon Generation 1 games (Red, Blue, Yellow).
They are designed to either be run using TimoVM’s Nickname Writer or to be installed with it in BlipBlopMenu or TimOS environment.

Fully compatible with TimOS / BlipBlopMenu
This repository serves as a library for my ACE scripts for Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow English versions.

Each script is built using QuickRGBDS
