# ACE Scripts for English Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow

This repository contains my collection of Arbitrary Code Execution scripts for Pokémon Generation 1 games (Red, Blue, Yellow).
They are designed to either be run using TimoVM’s Nickname Writer or to be installed with it in BlipBlopMenu or TimOS environment.

----
### Features

- Ready-to-install HEX payloads
- Compatible with original cartridges, VC and emulators
- Assembly source code for learning and customization purposes


### Requirements
- A Gen 1 English Pokémon ROM or cartridge
- An emulator like BGB or an actual Gameboy
- Installation of [BlipBlopMenu](https://github.com/M4n0zz/BlipBlopMenu2) or [TimOS](https://glitchcity.wiki/wiki/Guides:TimoVM%27s_gen_1_ACE_setups) environment
- [QuickRGBDS](https://github.com/M4n0zz/QuickRGBDS) (optional)


### Installation

1. **Insert code:**
Use [Nickname Writer](https://glitchcity.wiki/wiki/Guides:Nickname_Writer_Codes) to insert the nickname codes, or alternatively, copy and paste the hex code directly into the appropriate memory address using an emulator:
- $D8B5 for Pokémon Red & Blue
- $D8B4 for Pokémon Yellow

2. **Run code:**
Press Start in the nickname verification screen to run the code.

3. **Verify installation (installers only):**
Open the script selector and run the last script on the list. If everything was successful, the total number of available scripts should have increased by one, and the installed script should run without any issues.
