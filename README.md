# ACE Scripts for English Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow

This repository contains my collection of Arbitrary Code Execution scripts for Pokémon Generation 1 games (Red, Blue, Yellow).
They are designed to either be run using TimoVM’s Nickname Writer or to be installed with it in BlipBlopMenu or TimOS environment.

----
### Features

- Ready-to-install HEX payloads
- Compatible with original cartridges, VC and emulators
- Assembly source code for learning and customization purposes


### Requirements
- A Gen 1 English Pokémon ROM or cartridge
- An emulator like BGB or an actual Gameboy
- Installation of [BlipBlopMenu](https://github.com/M4n0zz/BlipBlopMenu2) or [TimOS](https://glitchcity.wiki/wiki/Guides:TimoVM%27s_gen_1_ACE_setups) environment
- [QuickRGBDS](https://github.com/M4n0zz/QuickRGBDS) (optional)


### Installation

1. **Import via Nickname Writer:**
Use [Nickname Writer](https://glitchcity.wiki/wiki/Guides:Nickname_Writer_Codes) to import the hex code into your save file.

2. **Verify installation:**
Once in-game, open the TimOS script selector and run the last script on the list. If everything was successful, the total number of available scripts should have increased by one, and the installed script should run without any issues.
