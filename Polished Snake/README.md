# Polished Snake

This script adds a polished version of snake game, inspired by TheZZAZZGlitch's version.

Some new features added:
- Added new graphics
- Controls feel natural and stable
- Added level up logic that speeds up snake
- Added score counter
- Added best score autosave

### Installation

The script is available with the installer option only, since it uses Nickname Writer's unused battle data as a place to create snake's internal buffer
