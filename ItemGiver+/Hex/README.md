### Installation

1. **Insert code:**
Use [Nickname Writer](https://glitchcity.wiki/wiki/Guides:Nickname_Writer_Codes) to insert the nickname codes, or alternatively, copy and paste the hex code directly into the appropriate memory address using an emulator:
- $D8B5 for Pokémon Red & Blue
- $D8B4 for Pokémon Yellow

2. **Run code:**
Press Start in the nickname verification screen to run the code.

3. **Verify installation: (Installers only)**
Open the script selector and run the last script on the list. If everything was successful, the total number of available scripts should have increased by one, and the installed script should run without any issues.
