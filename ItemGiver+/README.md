# ItemGiver+

ItemGiver+ creates a menu that lets you safely obtain any item in the game in any quantity, without needing to know its internal hex ID. Furthermore you can delete the last item in your bag by pressing any key along with button B.

This script is designed for simplicity, especially when creating item-based ACE payloads.

### How to Use

The script comes in 3 different forms:

- Auto Installer: It automatically finds unused memory and installs the script inside TimOS region.
- Static Installer: It installs the script in a predefined memory address.
- Standalone: The script can run temporarily and it is lost after the game restarts or a trainer battle is initiated.
